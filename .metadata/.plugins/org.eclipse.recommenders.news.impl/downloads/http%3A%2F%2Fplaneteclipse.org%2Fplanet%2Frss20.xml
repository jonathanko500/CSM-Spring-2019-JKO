	<title>Mike Milinkovich: Frequently Asked Questions About Jakarta EE 8</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://eclipse-foundation.blog/?p=1495</guid>
	<link>https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2019/05/08/jakarta-ee-8-faq/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the community for the level of engagement we’ve seen in response to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2019/05/03/jakarta-ee-java-trademarks/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from last week.   This post, which again represents the consensus view of the Jakarta EE Steering Committee, answers some questions about Jakarta EE 8, which is planned as the initial release of Jakarta EE, and is intended to be fully compatible with Java EE 8, including use of the javax namespace.   We thought it would be useful to reiterate the messages we have been delivering about this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this post is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; about future Jakarta releases where the namespace will be changed. There is a vigorous discussion going on right now on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/jakartaee-platform-dev&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jakarta-platform-dev@eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt; list (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;), so if you are interested in that topic, I would suggest you participate there. We expect that it will be about a month before the Jakarta EE Spec Committee will determine the next steps in the Jakarta EE roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will Jakarta EE 8 break existing Java EE applications that rely upon javax APIs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Jakarta EE 8 will not break existing existing Java EE applications that rely upon javax APIs.   We expect Jakarta EE 8 to be completely compatible with Java EE 8. We expect Jakarta EE 8 to specify the same javax namespace, and the same javax APIs and the same behavior as is specified in Java EE 8.    We expect that implementations that pass the Java EE 8 TCKs will also pass the Jakarta EE 8 TCKs, because the Jakarta EE 8 TCKs will be based on the same sources as the Java EE 8 TCKs. Jakarta EE 8 will not require any changes to Java EE 8 applications or their use of javax APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will Jakarta EE 8 consist of?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta EE 8 specifications will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be fully compatible with Java EE 8 specifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the same APIs and Javadoc using the same javax namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide open source licensed Jakarta EE 8 TCKs that are based on, and fully compatible with, the Java EE 8 TCKs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include a Jakarta EE 8 Platform specification that will describe the same platform integration requirements as the Java EE 8 Platform specification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference multiple compatible  implementations of the Jakarta EE 8 Platform when the Jakarta EE 8 specifications are released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a compatibility and branding process for demonstrating that implementations are Jakarta EE 8 compatible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will there be Jakarta EE 8 compatible implementations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Multiple compatible implementations of the Jakarta EE 8 Platform will be available when the Jakarta EE 8 specifications are released.  We expect that any Java EE 8 compatible implementation would also be Jakarta EE 8 compatible, and the vendors in the Jakarta EE Working Group intend to certify their Java EE 8 compatible implementations as Jakarta EE 8 compatible.  In addition, because the Jakarta EE TCKs are available under an open source license, we will “lower the bar” for other technology providers to demonstrate Jakarta EE compatibility for their implementations. The lower cost and more liberal Jakarta EE trademark licensing will allow more technology providers to leverage and strengthen the Jakarta EE brand in the Enterprise Java community.  Jakarta EE 8 will provide a new baseline for the evolution of the Jakarta EE technologies, under an open, vendor-neutral community-driven process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the process for delivery of Jakarta EE 8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for delivery of Jakarta EE 8 specifications will be fully transparent and will follow the Jakarta EE Specification Process.  Expect to see in coming weeks the delivery of initial, draft Jakarta EE 8 component specifications corresponding to Java EE 8 component specifications.  These will contain Javadoc defining the relevant APIs, and TCKs for compatibility testing. To publish specification text, we need to acquire copyright licenses for this text.  We have obtained Oracle and IBM’s copyright licenses for their  contributions, and intend to obtain the remaining copyright licenses required to publish the text of the Jakarta EE 8 Platform specification, and as much as possible of the component specifications. If you contributed to the Java EE specifications at the JCP in the past, expect to be contacted by the Eclipse Foundation to provide a license to use your contributions in Jakarta EE going forward. Providing such a license will be an important step in supporting the new specification process and the Jakarta EE community.  You will see these draft specifications evolve to final specifications in an open community process. Join the specification projects and participate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When will Jakarta EE 8 be delivered?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta EE Working Group intends to release final Jakarta EE 8 specifications by the fall of 2019.    This is an open community-driven effort, so there will be transparency into the process of driving the Jakarta EE 8 specifications, delivery of the Jakarta EE 8 TCKs, and Jakarta EE 8 compatible implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Eclipse Contributor Agreement 3.0</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5567</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2019/05/07/eclipse-contributor-agreement-3-0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php&quot;&gt;Eclipse Contributor Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (ECA) is an agreement made by contributors certifying the work they are contributing was authored by them and/or they have the legal authority to contribute as open source under the terms of the project license.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Foundation’s IP Team has been working hard to get the various agreements that we maintain between the Eclipse Foundation and community updated. Our first milestone targeted the ECA, and we’re happy to report that a very significant number of our community members have successfully updated theirs. Today, we retired all of the rest of them. Specifically, we’ve revoked all ECAs that predate the ECA version 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re confident that we’ve managed to connect and update the ECA for everybody who still wants to be a contributor, so there should be no interruption for anybody who is actively contributing. If we missed you, you’ll be asked to sign the new ECA the next time you try to contribute. Or you can just &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/eca&quot;&gt;re-sign it now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve made some changes with the new agreements that make contributing easier, (but explaining harder). Committers who have signed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseIndividualCommitterAgreementFinal.pdf&quot;&gt;Individual Committer Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (ICA) version 4.0 or work for a company that has signed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreementFinal.pdf&quot;&gt;Member Committer and Contributor Agreement&lt;/a&gt; do not require an ECA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contact emo_records@eclipse.org if you’re having trouble with an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: Update on Jakarta EE Rights to Java Trademarks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://eclipse-foundation.blog/?p=1492</guid>
	<link>https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2019/05/03/jakarta-ee-java-trademarks/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of progress to date and implications of the agreement between Eclipse and Oracle on Jakarta EE and use of Java trademarks and the javax namespace.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation has been an enormous effort on behalf of the Eclipse Foundation staff and the many contributors, committers, members, and stakeholders that are participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was reviewed and represents the consensus view of the Jakarta EE Steering Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year GlassFish 5.1 was certified at Eclipse using the Java EE 8 TCK at the Eclipse Foundation. Since then under the direction of the working group the community established a Jakarta EE Specification Process (JESP) for the evolution of the Jakarta EE specs at the Eclipse Foundation. Specification projects are being created for all of the Jakarta EE specifications. The TCK process is being refined for Jakarta EE in concert with the new Jakarta EE compatibility logo. This is all being done in support of the Jakarta EE 8 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progress to Date&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta community has been busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle contributed GlassFish and the Java EE APIs and TCKs to Jakarta EE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jakarta EE Working Group was formed and supporting committees to provide governance to the community and facilitate collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse GlassFish was certified with the Java EE TCK at the Eclipse Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Specification Process&lt;/a&gt; was created, and customization created and approved for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/about/jesp/&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Specification Process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specification projects are being created and work is underway now within the community to deliver the Jakarta EE 8 release later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an initiative underway for Oracle, IBM, Red Hat and other members of the JCP to contribute their specification documents created at the JCP to Jakarta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been the mutual intention of the Eclipse Foundation and Oracle to agree to terms that would allow the evolution of the javax package namespace in Jakarta EE specifications.   Unfortunately, following many months of good-faith negotiations, the Eclipse Foundation and Oracle have been unable to agree on terms of an agreement for the Eclipse Foundation community to modify the javax package namespace or to use the Java trademarks currently used in Java EE specifications.  &lt;b&gt; Instead, Eclipse and Oracle have agreed that the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;javax&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; package namespace cannot be evolved by the Jakarta EE community. As well, Java trademarks such as the existing specification names cannot be used by Jakarta EE specifications. &lt;/b&gt; Because of the complexity and confidential nature of our negotiations, the Eclipse Foundation and Oracle have also agreed that we will not attempt to characterize here what has resulted in this outcome. It is the best outcome we could mutually achieve for the community. Some additional context is provided in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/boardminutes/2019_03_26_Minutes.pdf&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/meeting_minutes/&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Steering Committee&lt;/a&gt; meeting minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What restrictions does this outcome impose on the Eclipse community?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle’s Java trademarks are the property of Oracle and the Eclipse Foundation has no rights to use them.   The implications of this are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The javax package namespace may be used within Jakarta EE specifications but may be used “as is” only.  No modification to the javax package namespace is permitted within Jakarta EE component specifications. Jakarta EE specifications that continue to use the javax package namespace must remain TCK compatible with the corresponding Java EE specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta EE component specifications using the javax package namespace may be omitted entirely from future Jakarta EE Platform specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specification names must be changed from a “Java EE” naming convention to a “Jakarta EE” naming convention.  This includes acronyms such as EJB, JPA or JAX-RS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, any specifications which use the javax namespace will continue to carry the certification and container requirements which Java EE has had in the past. I.e., implementations which claim compliance with any version of the Jakarta EE specifications using the javax namespace must test on and distribute containers which embed certified Java SE implementations licensed by Oracle. These restrictions do not apply to Jakarta EE specifications which do not utilize javax, including future revisions of the platform specifications which eliminate javax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the ratified Jakarta EE specifications will be available under a different license (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/legal/efsl.php&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Specification License&lt;/a&gt;). This is the reason why the Eclipse Foundation is currently asking the community to update their contributor and committer agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is next for the Jakarta EE Working Group?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta EE Working Group including Oracle will continue to do what they set out to do: namely, move Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. The group remains committed to creating a Jakarta EE 8 specification, logoed under the Eclipse Foundation’s Jakarta trademark. Further, the group is also committed to future versions of the Jakarta EE specifications that deliver on the original promises of innovation and evolution in cloud-native Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does it mean for Jakarta EE to not modify the javax package namespace?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agreement does allow for modification and evolution under a new namespace, such as jakarta. It is expected that all future evolution and innovation will not use the javax namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens to the Jakarta EE brand?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta EE compatibility and the Jakarta EE member logos have both been decided on by the community and published. Work is underway to deliver the branding usage guidelines and supporting trademark license agreement. We expect to see the usage of these brands later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will there be a Jakarta EE 8?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The community is working hard to deliver the Jakarta EE 8 release, which is Java EE 8 delivered from Eclipse. We expect that many application servers will certify as Jakarta EE 8 compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens beyond Jakarta EE 8?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guiding principle for Jakarta EE 9 will be to maximize compatibility with Jakarta EE 8 for future versions without stifling innovation.  This will most likely involve two key topics: migration of some or all of the Jakarta EE specification source to a new namespace for future evolution; means to provide backwards compatibility with javax at a binary level, allowing old applications to run on Jakarta 9 implementations with some form of build or runtime tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while there will be a point in time where future versions of specifications will have to go through a source code incompatible change with respect to the previous javax based packages, this will be a straightforward transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further plans are being evolved by the Jakarta EE community via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Platform Project&lt;/a&gt;. Your comments and participation are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does this mean for the EE4J projects?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification projects need to be renamed to not use Oracle’s Java trademarks. The Jakarta community gets to decide on the new names. This is an opportunity to tighten up the naming and get a better level of consistency. The future of Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) projects will be determined by the community who participate in those specifications and open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is next for Eclipse GlassFish?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is underway at the Eclipse GlassFish project running the Jakarta EE 8 TCK and being ready to support its role in the TCK for interop testing. The future of Eclipse GlassFish will be determined by the community who participate in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How will specs be updated beyond Jakarta EE 8?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jakarta EE specifications will be updated according to the approved Jakarta EE Specification Process (JESP). The actual enhancements will be determined by the community who participate in those specification projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;30-40 min technical talk by the community&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is also an opportunity for 10-15 min update on Jakarta EE from Eclipse Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jakarta EE Update&lt;/em&gt; (formerly: Jakarta EE WG) calls - open to WG &lt;a href=&quot;http:// jakarta.ee-wg@eclipse.org&quot;&gt;jakarta.ee-wg@eclipse.org &lt;/a&gt; and wider community  &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jakarta.ee-community@eclipse.org&quot;&gt;jakarta.ee-community@eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The meeting invite is in the new public calendar &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eclipse-foundation.org_3281qms6riu4kdf354jn5idon0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America%2FToronto&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Community Calendar &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is a monthly occurrence, every second Wednesday of the month (avoiding the same week as Jakarta Tech Talks)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This meeting is to be prepared and organized by the Jakarta EE Working Group members and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U81TZ2F_nhg6WxoE1VnpUUEQ09r8SXWpaN3hf3wiTWQ/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;agenda to be shared with the community &lt;/a&gt;prior to the call&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Use the time slot for occasional updates from Eclipse Foundation and strategic members (Executive Director and panel)  - Jakarta Town Hall&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jakarta Town Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We had 2 very successful instances of town hall meetings - first at EclipseCon Europe 2018 and A year in review in late January 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;EF organized Events and Conferences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;JakartaOne Live - virtual one-day event, targeting users and adopters. Planned for the second week of September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe - 4-day Eclipse event, with dedicated Cloud Native Java track, community day event scheduled, likely Jakarta Town Hall.  Scheduled for October 21-24, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Duplicate code makes me itch, until I scratch it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fLJUnvCEnjFcNLhc5Wbgqg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Itchy scratchy hay!&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;I hate code duplication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing bothers me quite like code duplication. I get an unbearable itch every time I spot some duplication in a code base. The only way to make the itch go away is to find a suitable way to remove the duplication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am always reminded of this quote from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/testdrivendevelopment/conversations/topics/185?viscount=100&quot;&gt;Yahoo Groups post from Ryan King&lt;/a&gt; many years ago when I spot code duplication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So, duplication sucks. The more rabidly a person hates duplication, the more I trust their opinions on managing information. A programmer, upon noticing some redundancy, should be thrown into a panic, begin hyperventilating, and stammer something about “¡El diablo! !El diablo está en mi software!”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— Ryan King&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can we do when we find code duplication? We can learn ways to remove it. Google and StackOverflow are great resources for finding answers to solving many common programming problems. They can be your first port of call for discovering and learning new APIs that may help reduce some of the duplicate code you may have written previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Simple patterns of duplication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes code duplication is easy to spot and to remove. I will start by describing some very simple common patterns of duplication I spot in code bases all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Boolean Test Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing a boolean value and returning true or false. I’ve seen this pattern of code more than you might imagine over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public boolean isSomething()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    if (!this.calculateSomeBooleanValue())&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        return true;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;    else&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        return false;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write this instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public boolean isSomething()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    return !this.calculateSomeBooleanValue();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Collection Factory Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s another simple pattern that can be fixed easily. This kind of code is very commonly written in test cases. It is important to address code duplication issues across your entire code base, including tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;br /&gt;list.add(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;list.add(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;list.add(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code can be replaced as follows using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@donraab/as-a-matter-of-factory-part-1-mutable-75cc2c5d72d9&quot;&gt;mutable factory pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an answer on StackOverflow that show different &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1005073/initialization-of-an-arraylist-in-one-line/28183168#28183168&quot;&gt;ways to initialize a List, Set, and Bag in one line with Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Unmodifiable Static Collection Initializer Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following code used to be common in Java versions prior to Java 9, for creating a static unmodifiable List.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;LIST&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;static&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; newList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;br /&gt;    newList.add(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    newList.add(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    newList.add(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;em&gt;LIST &lt;/em&gt;= Collections.&lt;em&gt;unmodifiableList&lt;/em&gt;(newList);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be written more simply as follows using plain old Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LIST &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;=&lt;br /&gt;        Collections.&lt;em&gt;unmodifiableList&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;                Arrays.&lt;em&gt;asList&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can also be replaced as follows using Eclipse Collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; LIST =&lt;br /&gt;        Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;).asUnmodifiable();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Java 9, you can also write the following. The method List.of() returns an unmodifiable List.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; LIST = &lt;br /&gt;        List.&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use an ImmutableList from Eclipse Collections if you want to have a contractually immutable interface like ImmutableList which has no mutating methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; LIST = &lt;br /&gt;        Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Static Map Initializer Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initializing a static Map can be a bit more challenging, if you have more than three or four key/value pairs in the Map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final Map&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;static&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    Map&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; newMap = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;br /&gt;    newMap.put(1, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    newMap.put(2, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    newMap.put(3, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    newMap.put(4, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;four&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    newMap.put(5, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;five&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAP &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;= Collections.&lt;em&gt;unmodifiableMap&lt;/em&gt;(newMap);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactored to use an Eclipse collections unmodifiable map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final Map&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAP &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;=&lt;br /&gt;        Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt;empty()&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(1, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(2, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(3, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(4, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;four&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(5, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;five&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .asUnmodifiable();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactored to use an Eclipse collections ImmutableMap which also has no mutating methods in its interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static final ImmutableMap&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAP &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;=&lt;br /&gt;        Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt;empty()&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(1, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(2, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(3, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(4, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;four&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .withKeyValue(5, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;five&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;                .toImmutable();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a an answer on StackOverflow that shows various &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/507602/how-can-i-initialise-a-static-map/13943037#13943037&quot;&gt;ways to initialize a static map with Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Iteration Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons I started building &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; was that I would see developers writing the same for-loops over and over again. Developers were constantly reimplementing collection iteration patterns in Java. I saw code duplication everywhere! Developers did this prior to Java 8 because the iteration patterns available to Java developers then were limited to what could be found on the Collections utility class. Eclipse Collections has been in development and used in production since JDK 1.4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; has been my preferred solution for removing duplicate iteration pattern code for the past fifteen years in Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Filter Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Java 8, the following was the usual way of filtering a source collection to a target collection based on some condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; target = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;br /&gt;for (Integer value : source)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    if (value % 2 == 0)&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        target.add(value);&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same code refactored using the Eclipse Collections select method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; target = source.select(each -&amp;gt; each % 2 ==0);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/122105/what-is-the-best-way-to-filter-a-java-collection/12573823#12573823&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; on StackOverflow to the question of “What is the best way to filter a Java Collection?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Transform Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Java 8, the following was the typical way of converting one collection type to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; target = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;br /&gt;for (Integer value : source)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    target.add(value.toString());&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same code refactored using the Eclipse Collections collect method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; target = source.collect(Object::toString);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Any / All / None Patterns&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Java 8, you would either use a break statement with a boolean variable or a direct return from inside an if statement to see if any, all, or none of the elements of a collection match a given condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Any Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;boolean &lt;strong&gt;anyEvens &lt;/strong&gt;= false;&lt;br /&gt;for (Integer value : source)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    if (value % 2 == 0)&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;anyEvens &lt;/strong&gt;= true;&lt;br /&gt;        break;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactored with Eclipse Collections anySatisfy method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;boolean anyEvens = source.anySatisfy(each -&amp;gt; each % 2 == 0);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;All Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;boolean &lt;strong&gt;allEvens &lt;/strong&gt;= true;&lt;br /&gt;for (Integer value : source)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    if (value % 2 != 0)&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;allEvens &lt;/strong&gt;= false;&lt;br /&gt;        break;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactored with Eclipse Collections allSatisfy method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;boolean allEvens = source.allSatisfy(each -&amp;gt; each % 2 == 0);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;None Pattern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;boolean &lt;strong&gt;noneEvens &lt;/strong&gt;= true;&lt;br /&gt;for (Integer value : source)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    if (value % 2 == 0)&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;noneEvens &lt;/strong&gt;= false;&lt;br /&gt;        break;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactored with Eclipse Collections noneSatisfy method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;MutableList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; source = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);&lt;br /&gt;boolean noneEvens = source.noneSatisfy(each -&amp;gt; each % 2 == 0);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other Iteration Patterns&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other iteration patterns available in Eclipse Collections that can help you remove duplicate code. There are over one hundred variations of iteration patterns and other APIs available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.2.0/org/eclipse/collections/api/RichIterable.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;RichIterable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; parent interface alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Br4eQEhSsLeRZ1EVZIHhPA.png&quot; /&gt;RichIterable APIs&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sometimes code duplication is necessary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally code duplication is the best available solution to solve a performance problem. A great example in Eclipse Collections is the primitive collections. Eclipse Collections has primitive collection support for Lists, Sets, Bags, Stacks and Maps for all eight primitive combinations (boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, short). The code to implement all of these container types is nearly identical. So if you read the code for an IntArrayList it will look eerily similar to the code in ShortArrayList and LongArrayList. What is important in cases where you want to provide library support for primitive types in Java is to leverage a code generation strategy wherever possible and to not duplicate the code by hand. With Eclipse Collections, we use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stringtemplate.org/&quot;&gt;StringTemplate&lt;/a&gt; library and write templates once for each container type that are then used to generate the eight container types required to support all of the primitives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, if the work in &lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/&quot;&gt;Project Valhalla&lt;/a&gt; becomes part of a JDK release and we get support for generic specialization over primitive types, we may have new language level strategies in Java to reduce the amount of generated code we have to produce today to support primitive types. I am very excited to see how this support may potentially reduce our code duplication burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional Patterns of Duplication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more patterns of duplication out there. Your IDE and various code analysis tools can sometimes help you find the obvious ones caused by copy and paste. Other times you may just need to read your code and see if you can recognize patterns where some code is going into too much detail about &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to do something (for loops are sometimes a cue). Code that is written well should tell you clearly &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; it is doing, not how it is doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleting duplicate code makes me feel very satisfied. It helps reduce the total cost of ownership for a an application or library. Less code to read, test, maintain, and deploy means less potential bugs to discover, debug and fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is open for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;contributions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

	<title>Chris Aniszczyk: Ways your company can support and sustain open source</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.aniszczyk.org/?p=4282</guid>
	<link>https://www.aniszczyk.org/2019/04/30/ways-your-company-can-support-and-sustain-open-source/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this article was original posted on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/article/19/4/ways-support-sustain-open-source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://opensource.com/article/19/4/ways-support-sustain-open-source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure open source continues to thrive, we all need to find ways to sustain the communities and projects we depend on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of open source continues to grow; surveys show that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/blackducksoftware/2016-future-of-open-source-survey-results&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;majority of companies&lt;/a&gt;use some form of open source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-ebook-f16984bf-201904-en_0.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;99% of enterprises see open source as important&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#developer-profile-_-contributing-to-open-source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;almost half of developers&lt;/a&gt; are contributing back. It’s important to note that companies aren’t contributing to open source for purely altruistic reasons. Recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091831&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard shows that open source-contributing companies capture up to 100% more productive value from open source than companies that do not contribute back. Another research &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/government-technology-policy-social-value-and-national-competitiveness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; concluded countries adopting modern open source practices saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a 0.6%–5.4% yearly increase in companies that use OSS, a 9%–18% yearly increase in the number of IT-related startups, a 6.6%–14% yearly increase in the number of individuals employed in IT related jobs, and a 5%–16% yearly decrease in software-related patents. All of these outcomes help to increase productivity and competitiveness at the national level. In aggregate, these results show that changes in government technology policy that favor OSS can have a positive impact on both global social value and domestic national competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, there are many ways for a company or organization to sustain open source. It could be as simple as training your organization to contribute to open source projects you depend on or hiring engineers to work on open source projects. Here are eight ways your organization can contribute back to open source, based on examples in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hire open source maintainers to work on open source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies with strategies to leverage open source often find the highest returns from hiring a maintainer of the projects they depend the most on. It’s no surprise if you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/2017-linux-kernel-report-landing-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Who Writes the Linux Kernel report&lt;/a&gt; that the top contributors are all employed by companies like ARM, Google, Facebook, Intel, Red Hat, Samsung, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a maintainer (full time or part time) on your staff can help your organization learn how to work within the project community and enable prioritization of upstream contributions based on understanding of what the community is focused on. Hiring the maintainers also means that the project will have people with enough time to focus on the details and the rigor that’s needed for a project to be useful; think security reviews, bug cleanup, release management, and more. A more predictable and reliable upstream project can benefit many in your organization while also improving the overall project community. As a bonus, maintainers can also become advocates for your organization and help with recruiting too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop an open source award program or peer bonus fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common for companies to have internal employee recognition programs that recognize individuals who go above and beyond. As an example, Red Hat has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/article/19/2/community-awards-2019&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;community award program&lt;/a&gt; through Opensource.com. Some other companies have expanded their recognition programs to include open source contributors. For example, Google has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.google.com/docs/growing/peer-bonus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open source peer bonus program&lt;/a&gt; that recognizes external people who have made exceptional contributions to open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Congratulations to our Open Source Peer Bonus winners! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LA1MsnsSQf&quot;&gt;https://t.co/LA1MsnsSQf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Google Open Source (@GoogleOSS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoogleOSS/status/1121825826939424768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start an open source program office&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many internet-scale companies, including Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter and more, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/article/18/1/how-start-open-source-program-your-company&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;established formal open source programs&lt;/a&gt; (colloquially called OSPOs) within their organizations to manage open source strategy along with the consumption and contribution of open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase your contributions to open source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/todogroup/survey/tree/master/2018#companies-with-an-open-source-program-more-likely-to-contribute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that companies with formal open source programs are more likely to contribute back. If you want to learn from organizations with formal open source programs, I recommend you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://todogroup.org/guides/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TODO Group Open Source Program Guides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Launch an open source fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organizations contribute fiscally to the open source projects that are important to them. For example, Comcast’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovationfund.comcast.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Source Development Grants&lt;/a&gt; “are intended to fund new or continued development of open source software in areas of interest to Comcast or of benefit to the Internet and broadband industries.” This isn’t just for big companies; small companies have open source funds, too. For example, CarGurus launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cargurus.com/press/cargurus_engineers_launch_open_source_fund.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open source fund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.geteventbot.com/2019/01/06/how-we-support-open-source-software.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eventbot&lt;/a&gt; is supporting open source with a small percentage of its company revenue. Another interesting approach is what Indeed has done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/community_sustaining_foss_projects_democratizing_sponsorship/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;democratizing the open source funding process&lt;/a&gt; with its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribute a portion of your company equity to open source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider donating a portion of your organization’s equity to an open source project you depend on. For example, Citus Data recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/10/24/why-citus-data-is-donating-1-percent-equity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;donated one percent of its equity&lt;/a&gt; to the PostgreSQL community. This worked out nicely; Citus Data was acquired by Microsoft recently, so the PostgreSQL community will benefit from that acquisition, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support and join open source foundations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many open source foundations that house open source projects your organization depends on, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apache.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cncf.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (home of Kubernetes), &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphql.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GraphQL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OSI), &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstack.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenStack Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NodeJS Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;CNCF's Annual Report just published &amp;amp; it's packed with stats around the Foundation's growth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/KubeCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#KubeCon&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CloudNativeCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CloudNativeCon&lt;/a&gt; data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/cloudnative?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#cloudnative&lt;/a&gt; project updates + maintainer satisfaction, ecosystem tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevStats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevStats&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; more!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fund and participate in open source internships or retreats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many open source internship programs that you can participate in and help fund. &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; (GSoC) is the largest, and it requires mentorship from employees who work on open source projects as part of the program. Or you can sponsor internships for underrepresented minorities in open source through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreachy.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://communitybridge.org/faq/#people&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CommunityBridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Introducing CommunityBridge, a platform to accelerate innovation, sustainability, funding, security, mentoring, and diversity in open source projects. Join the private early access program: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/22eGhqNbCt&quot;&gt;https://t.co/22eGhqNbCt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— The Linux Foundation (@linuxfoundation) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/linuxfoundation/status/1105581918278635521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 12, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to host an open source retreat at your company. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stripe hosts open source retreats&lt;/a&gt; to contribute to open source projects it depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Include open source in your corporate philanthropy initiatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your organization has a corporate sustainability or philanthropic arm, consider working with that team to include open source as a part of its work. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Software-Philanthropy-for-Everyone-Kevin-P.-Fleming-Bloomberg.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg has a software philanthropy budget&lt;/a&gt; for projects it depends on, from Git to Eclipse to Python and more. In the future, I hope to see more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_sustainability&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corporate sustainability&lt;/a&gt; and philanthropy efforts—like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pledge1percent.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pledge 1%&lt;/a&gt;—that focus on funding critical open source infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, giving back to open source is not only the right thing to do, according to research, it’s also good for your business. To make sure open source continues to thrive and is sustainable in the long run, we all need to ensure that companies find ways to sustain the open source communities they depend on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://eclipse-foundation.blog/?p=1490</guid>
	<link>https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2019/04/24/eclipse-foundation-on-the-move/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After 15 years at 102 Centrepointe Drive in Ottawa, the Eclipse Foundation is on the move. We will now be located at 2934 Baseline Road, Suite 202, Ottawa, ON, K2H 1B2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2004, when we took the space current space on Centrepointe, there were only three of us on staff. Fifteen years later we have been joined by over 20 more staff in the Ottawa office, where we now occupy all three floors of our building. With this growth, we have simply outgrown our existing space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 6th, we move to a new office space nearby that allows us all to be on one floor and doesn’t significantly increase travel time for anyone on our team. The decision to move to one floor was largely based on research that shows that having employees on one floor improves collaboration and offers more opportunities for interactions, thereby building relationships. Our new office also allows room for us to grow as we continue to grow. These fresh new facilities offer several benefits for our company, such as a free gym, lots of green space (think outdoor meetings where creativity can bloom), an on-site cafeteria which provides healthy food options, several in-office meeting rooms and a large boardroom where we can host our larger meetings…and have a few parties for our hard-working staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  you are in the area, please drop by and say hello. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to show you our amazing new digs!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Doug Schaefer: The “Next” Eclipse CDT</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/6d09d0b1ec27</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/@dougschaefer/the-next-eclipse-cdt-6d09d0b1ec27?source=rss-8f7a70438965------2</link>
	<description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*uI7gTFqPmJxQjk6rJWkejQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;CDT Summit at EclipseCon Europe 2016&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my last article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dougschaefer/the-journey-to-a-new-eclipse-cdt-3855ec52334&quot;&gt;I walked through a bit of the history of the Eclipse CDT project&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great story of the trials and tribulations of community building, working with a group of like minded platform vendors, even competitors, who just wanted a great IDE and who knew the only way to get that was to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sticks with me most looking back on my ump-teen years on the project is the people. Each of these vendors were led by passionate tools developers who put aside any hint of corporate agenda and just wanted to work with other developers from around the world, to solve hard problems, and build something they would be proud of. Through the semi regular face-to-face CDT Summits and CDT days at EclipseCons past we were able to build relationships and become great friends. Even after some have moved on, I still remain in contact with many of them and we still share a laugh or two, and even the odd beer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I offer no apologies if, as participation has dwindled on the project in recent years, I yearn for those days. But my personal enjoyment working in this environment is one thing, &lt;strong&gt;I don’t think the job is done&lt;/strong&gt;. The C++ language continues to evolve and become more usable and powerful than ever before. Even C continues to receive updates. And more importantly, the IDE landscape is changing and we need to keep up to keep our users and customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have always had to deal with users and even colleagues, who are hard core engineers, who refuse to give up their text editors and custom bash scripts. In the end, it’s been hard to argue with them. For these folk, IDEs don’t work the way they want to work. And, initially at least, it does slow them down as they fight the paradigm and they just end up frustrated and toss it aside losing all those gains we are trying to give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, I guess it was only a matter of time that an IDE platform would come along and offer the best of both worlds. Be a great unopinionated text editor, facilitate hooking up users’s bash scripts, be super extensible to add in little accelerators. It’s been brewing for a while. Sublime was the first such thing I saw developers really enjoy. And now, today, we have Visual Studio Code, which is becoming the dominant editor platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And funny enough, an interesting thing happens when you take a bunch of IDE developers and tell them to build a great editor, they end up building an editor so extensible that it slowly becomes an IDE. The VS Code team, many of them former Eclipsers, has managed to create a mechanism to add powerful language services to the editor. And, of all things, add support for debuggers. OK, you add debug support, you’re no longer an editor, you are an IDE. Stop pretending :).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even greater, the VS Code team has done this by creating standardized APIs and protocols that other IDEs can use. You can build common services and then plug them into your favorite IDE, even Eclipse!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new architecture, the path forward for the Eclipse CDT project is clear. We need to take all that C/C++ IDE knowledge we’ve built over the years and use that to build common components that can be used by other IDE platforms. It means growing beyond our Eclipse IDE roots to give users that great experience in the IDE that best works they way they want to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We as the CDT community have a lot to offer, and there really isn’t a community like it, that focuses on the needs of the C/C++ developer. The challenge will be to harness that energy again, to work together for the greater good that we can only accomplish together. It really is an exciting time to be an IDE developer and Eclipse is a great home for us to come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my next article I will start getting into the technical meat of what this new vision entails and what fun we can have building it! Time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=6d09d0b1ec27&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: The 2019 IoT Developer Survey Results are Live</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://eclipse-foundation.blog/?p=1488</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After months of hard work, the 2019 IoT Developer Survey results are live today. This year marks the fifth year the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse IoT Working Group&lt;/a&gt; has asked the global IoT developer community to share their perceptions, requirements, and priorities. The survey has proven to be an influential assessment of the IoT market as viewed from the development front lines. Access the full findings of the 2019 IoT Developer Survey &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2Z6SwiA&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 1,700 individuals took the survey between February and March 2019. Just like in previous years (see results from 2018, 2017, and earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/iot-developer-surveys/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), Eclipse IoT collaborated with key IoT ecosystem players like Bosch and Red Hat to maximize the reach of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key findings this year include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IoT drives real-world, commercial outcomes today. 65% of respondents are currently working on IoT projects professionally or will be in the next 18 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IoT developers mostly use C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS, Azure, and GCP are the leading IoT cloud platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top three industry focus areas remain the same as last year: IoT Platforms, Home Automation, and Industrial Automation / IIoT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MQTT remains the dominant IoT communication protocol leveraged by developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Eclipse Desktop IDE is the leading IDE for building IoT applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IoT gets real(er)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with our findings last year, two-thirds of the respondents to our survey develop and deploy IoT solutions today or will be doing so within 18 months. This continued focus on building and deploying real world solutions is reflected in the increases in developers’ focus on performance, connectivity, and standards shown in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C and Java dominate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C won out as the programming language of choice for constrained devices, while Java was most popular for gateways/edge nodes and IoT cloud. Neither of those findings are surprising. C and C++ have long been the languages of choice for small embedded systems where minimizing memory space and power consumption, and maximizing processor utilization are key. Java is the dominant language and platform where the memory and processing resources are larger, and the complexity of the systems are greater. In particular, Java is the language of choice for most cloud infrastructure projects, so seeing it lead in IoT cloud is consistent with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWS, Azure, and Google hold on to the lead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected AWS, Azure, and GCP maintain their status as the leading IoT cloud platforms. The list of three and their rankings are entirely consistent with their relative weights in the cloud computing marketplace as a whole, so there is no surprise to see this reflected in our results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A continued focus on platforms, home automation, and IIoT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IoT Platforms (34%), Home Automation (27%), and Industrial Automation / IIoT (26%) were the respondents’ three most common industry focus areas. These areas are likely to continue to be key targets for IoT developer activity.  The fact that IoT Platforms is consistently year after year the number one focus for IoT developers is interesting. It implies that enterprises and industrials are putting resources into building their own IoT platforms for use by their companies. To me this suggests that industrial IoT is going to be a huge opportunity for hybrid cloud, as companies build and run IoT solutions on-premise based using modern, open technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security is (still) top of mind &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is still the top concern for IoT developers. Communication Security (38%) Data Encryption (38%), and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) (26%) were the top three security technologies cited in the survey, with virtualization also starting to play a stronger role in IoT Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MQTT is still the dominant IoT communication protocol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP (49%), MQTT (42%), and Websockets (26%) were the top three communications protocols used by IoT developers. The growth in MQTT adoption over the past seven or eight years has been phenomenal, and I like to think that the Eclipse IoT community with its Eclipse Paho and Eclipse Mosquitto projects had a small part to play in that. Having robust open source implementations available has certainly been part of the MQTT’s success. Looking forward that main challenge we see for further MQTT adoption is the lack of interoperability built into the protocol. While MQTT is a great lightweight, low latency protocol it does not provide any guidance on the topic structures and payload definitions used by any device or application. This means that no two teams using MQTT would expect to have their systems be able to reliably exchange data. The Eclipse Tahu project defines the Sparkplug protocol — created by Arlen Nipper one of the co-inventors of MQTT itself. Sparkplug defines the topic structures and payload definitions necessary for out-of-the-box interoperability of SCADA systems. We are hopeful that Sparkplug could spur MQTT to even greater adoption in industrial IoT use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Eclipse Desktop IDE is the leading IoT IDE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45% of respondents use the Eclipse Desktop IDE. It is not at all surprising that the Eclipse IDE has a strong franchise with IoT developers, given the dominance of C and Java. The Eclipse CDT project has long been hugely important in the embedded software space. The past decade CDT has been used by virtually every chip, SOC, and RTOS company as the basis for their toolset. Those developer solutions also typically use additional tools such as the Target Management Framework, and Remote Systems Explorer that were specifically designed with the embedded developer in mind. That, coupled with the Eclipse IDE’s broad use amongst professional Java developers makes its leadership in IoT clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, close to 10% also use Eclipse Che, our community’s next generation cloud-based tooling solution. It really seems part of the future of IoT is in the cloud, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access the full findings of the 2019 IoT Developer Survey &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2Z6SwiA&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out this survey, and thanks again our Eclipse IoT members for their help with the promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very interested in hearing your thoughts and feedback about this year’s findings. And, of course, we are always open to suggestions on how to improve the survey in the future!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>itemis: How to reference UML elements from Xtext DSLs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blogs.itemis.com/en/how-to-reference-uml-elements-from-xtext-dsls</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.itemis.com/en/how-to-reference-uml-elements-from-xtext-dsls</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/&quot;&gt;Xtext framework&lt;/a&gt;, you can build DSL workbenches in just a few steps. However, sometimes you want to reuse model elements already defined in other formats or even in other languages. In this blog post I’m going to demonstrate typical scenarios when you’re reusing model elements belonging to a different language.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, consider having some pre-defined Eclipse UML2 models, and you want to reference classes of these UML models from your Xtext DSL.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in reusing model elements belonging to the same language but defined in different formats, take a look at my previous blog post “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hosting.itemis.de/en/combining-emf-models-with-xtext-dsls&quot;&gt;Combining EMF models with Xtext DSLs&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's get started with the preparatory steps:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Preparatory steps&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Install the latest version of the &lt;em&gt;UML2 Extender SDK&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Xtext Complete SDK&lt;/em&gt; of the Eclipse release train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;install-Xtext-Complete-SDK-and-UML2-Extender-SDK&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2019)/Software%20Development/How%20to%20reference%20UML%20elements%20from%20Xtext%20DSLs/install-Xtext-Complete-SDK-and-UML2-Extender-SDK.jpg?width=770&amp;amp;name=install-Xtext-Complete-SDK-and-UML2-Extender-SDK.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 770px;&quot; width=&quot;770&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create the &lt;em&gt;Domainmodel&lt;/em&gt; project, based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/102_domainmodelwalkthrough.html&quot;&gt;Xtext 15 Minutes Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. The meta-model of the &lt;em&gt;Domainmodel&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;meta-model-of-the-Domainmodel project&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2019)/Software%20Development/How%20to%20reference%20UML%20elements%20from%20Xtext%20DSLs/meta-model-of-the-Domainmodel%20project.jpg?width=750&amp;amp;name=meta-model-of-the-Domainmodel%20project.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 750px;&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;describes that a domain model consist of certain types (data types and entities), an entity contains features and each feature can have a type. To be able to use UML classes in the feature's type definition, the following modifications are necessary:&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Modifications&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;org.example.domainmodel&lt;/em&gt; plug-in&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Extend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/itemis/itemis-blog/blob/referencing-uml-elements-from-xtext-dsls/org.example.domainmodel/src/org/example/domainmodel/Domainmodel.xtext#L23&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domainmodel.xtext&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; grammar definition:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;grammar org.example.domainmodel.Domainmodel with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

&lt;h2&gt;Automated testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We have done the preparatory steps, modifications and testing necessary to reuse model elements belonging to a different language. This example has been kept simple on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Doug Schaefer: The Journey to a “New Eclipse CDT”</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/3855ec52334</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/@dougschaefer/the-journey-to-a-new-eclipse-cdt-3855ec52334?source=rss-8f7a70438965------2</link>
	<description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/756/1*mwdMRl-nYsZ3eQ_NRvfDRw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse CDT project has been around for a long time. The first code commits were in June 2002 when QNX contributed the core C/C++ tooling components of it’s fresh new Momentics IDE. For the time it was quite visionary. Platform vendors are more often focused on their platforms and provide tools as an enabler for developers to leverage the power of those platforms. Having every company replicate that effort only leads to poor tools and unhappy developers. It doesn’t scale. Why not join together with like-minded vendors and build something we can all benefit from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, we end up with a standard platform that allows developers to work with multiple environments on the same platform leading to some interesting partnership opportunities. At the very least developers acquire skills working with that IDE they can take to other jobs or even other projects in the same company. It truly is a win/win for everyone and makes for a very rich ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all long lasting projects, it has had it’s ebbs and flows. As we started, QNX and my team at Rational Software (later part of IBM) were the main contributors. There were a few others lurking around with a few contributions. The first few monthly CDT conference calls were cool as new voices appeared from around the world. It was a great start that led to the first EclipseCon where we had people standing in the hall trying to listen into our overflow birds of a feather session. We were overwhelmed by the interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t last forever and the powers that be decided my team at IBM was needed elsewhere in the company. Obviously I wasn’t pleased and certainly wasn’t ready to leave the community. So when Sebastien Marineau, the CDT project lead at the time suggested I come work for him at QNX, I jumped at the chance. It wasn’t the easiest of moves but it was my chance to do what I could to help keep the CDT machine rolling and ended up getting a good start on my pride and joy, CDT’s super-fast indexer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first CDT summit held in the fall of 2005 shortly after I had joined QNX, we had a lot of interest and it was well attended with over a dozen vendors present. We had some good presentations on what we were working on and some interesting presentations from other vendors on what they’d like to see in the project. Well someone said the wrong thing and I had to stop the proceedings. Of the 20 or so people in the room I asked the active contributors to stand up. There were four of us. How are they expecting this little team to do their bidding when the whole idea was to share in the effort and do something great together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s probably the proudest and hardest moment of my time on the CDT. It worked. And from the chart above you can see we had healthy growth and lots of vendors coming to help after that. Those were the best years for the project. Though for me personally, I never really did recover from my lost team at Rational/IBM and ended up moving around a bit, never leaving the CDT project but not really giving it my all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily and happily, for the last four years, I’ve been back at QNX working on that original Momentics IDE and contributing to Eclipse trying to make it easier to use for C/C++ developers including my favorite add, the Launch Bar. Our customers are happy, the community seems happy, and there are more and more vendors delivering product based on our work in open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But also from the chart you can see participation in the CDT has been on a worrying trajectory to a point where we once again have about 4 people actively working on it. Despite being as popular as ever, only a small percentage of people and companies out there are helping with the common cause. It’s made me sad, and frankly angry. And I must apologize to my friends at last year’s EclipseCon for losing control of that a bit, but when you have so many companies leveraging something you are passionately doing for free for them, thanks to my sympathetic employer, you feel taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the leader of the project, it’s up to me with the help of my open source colleagues to find a way to turn that around. And we have some ideas that I’m very excited about. My next few posts will talk about that and go into details of some very cool new efforts underway in the CDT project. The IDE world has changed but it’s needed more than ever and we are ready to adapt. We really hope you can join us and make it great, again…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=3855ec52334&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>N4JS: Automated rename refactoring in N4JS IDE</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7569987920628430132.post-2530662466762609742</guid>
	<link>https://n4js.blogspot.com/2019/03/automated-rename-refactoring-in-n4js.html</link>
	<description>Refactoring is probably one of the most important tools for us, software developers since we constantly need to change the structure of the code to improve the code quality or to prepare the code for new features etc. The most used refactoring operation is arguably &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;rename refactoring&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Find and replace could be used for renaming but the risk of renaming unrelated names is pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N4JS IDE provides a powerful way of automatically renaming a definition and all its references with a comparable user experience as rename refactoring of Eclipse Java Development Tool (JDT).  The slogan is: &lt;i&gt;I want to rename this thing, do it for me however you like but please in a safe manner so that I can move on! &lt;/i&gt;This will exactly be your experience with rename refactoring in N4JS IDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple rename example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Let's have look at a simple example to see how rename refactoring works in N4JS IDE in action. Assume that we have an N4JS file with the following content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzJHzyKNMWo/XJTEE071AaI/AAAAAAAAAGY/Qk9KvQbtCbksypaUt-GtCB4K7HJmKR0LwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_simple_example.png&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzJHzyKNMWo/XJTEE071AaI/AAAAAAAAAGY/Qk9KvQbtCbksypaUt-GtCB4K7HJmKR0LwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_simple_example.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When the cursor is at &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; of the constructor &lt;span&gt;new A()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;and we press Cmd + Shift + R to rename A to B, the rename refactoring suggests that it would rename A to B at 3 different locations. After entering the new name B and pressing enter, the class A and all its usages are renamed to B, fully automatically :-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Name conflicts detection &lt;/h3&gt;Renaming an element may cause name conflicts. The rename refactoring in N4JS IDE provides comprehensive checks for detecting name conflicts. If the new name would cause name conflicts, the rename refactoring is disallowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the example above,  renaming class A to class C would cause a name conflict because in the script scope the name C already exists. The rename refactoring provided by N4JS IDE can recognize this conflict and shows an error message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Um8f1tJZjo/XJS9OAQQx9I/AAAAAAAAAF4/GDRqLJkdf68TvRXI1Uh8SnxJVRSiXe_WACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_name_conflict.png&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Um8f1tJZjo/XJS9OAQQx9I/AAAAAAAAAF4/GDRqLJkdf68TvRXI1Uh8SnxJVRSiXe_WACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_name_conflict.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a large code base, these checks are a true life saver. Imagine having to manually verify these kinds of name conflicts across hundred of files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, N4JS IDE's rename refactoring is capable of recognizing name conflicts when renaming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;members of classifier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;formal parameters of a function or method&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;field of a structural type&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enum literal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;local variable, constant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;global variable, constant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rename composed members&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;N4JS language supports composed elements. Renaming a composed element is somewhat special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OdzTax12UZY/XKyF2jEua7I/AAAAAAAAAHs/tewAn07C-4QeuEnhUbWIcs1QTCpdmz6xACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_composed_member.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OdzTax12UZY/XKyF2jEua7I/AAAAAAAAAHs/tewAn07C-4QeuEnhUbWIcs1QTCpdmz6xACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_composed_member.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this example, &lt;span&gt;ab.foo&lt;/span&gt; is a composed member because &lt;span&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt; is of the intersection type &lt;span&gt;A &amp;amp; B&lt;/span&gt; which is composed of both &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;. Renaming &lt;span&gt;ab.foo&lt;/span&gt; would rename all the definitions that contribute to the creation of &lt;span&gt;ab.foo&lt;/span&gt; as well as all references of these definitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preview of changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;When you start rename refactoring operation, you have the possibility to see the preview of changes before actually executing the operation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPewaTL2sJA/XKyGV4ooRpI/AAAAAAAAAH0/N9ruEVuNOEMNAESq45rOUFzkAJOS8naxwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename-refactoring-preview.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPewaTL2sJA/XKyGV4ooRpI/AAAAAAAAAH0/N9ruEVuNOEMNAESq45rOUFzkAJOS8naxwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename-refactoring-preview.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Note that the preview shows the changes in each file in a very recognizable manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Undo changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the rename refactoring, if you feel regret and would like to undo the operation, simply press Cmd + Z. The undo will undo all the changes in affected files previously done by the rename refactoring.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Current limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;As the time of this writing, the rename refactoring in N4JS IDE still has several limitations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Renaming alias is not supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking name conflicts do not take into account shadowing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;By Minh Quang Tran&lt;/div&gt;</description>
